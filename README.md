# Mobile Addiction Behavioral Analysis

This repository presents a comprehensive machine learning pipeline designed to analyze patterns of smartphone and social media overuse. The objective is to build predictive models that quantify and classify addiction severity based on behavioral and demographic indicators.

---

## Project Scope

The project leverages a publicly available dataset from Kaggle to investigate:

* Behavioral signals associated with excessive smartphone usage.
* Predictive modeling of self-reported addiction scores.
* Classification of users into addicted vs. non-addicted categories.
* Feature importance interpretation and exploration of underlying usage patterns.

---

## Dataset Overview

* **Source**: Kaggle - Mobile Addiction Dataset
* **Features**: Includes screen time, app usage, notifications, stress levels, demographics, and more.
* **Quality**: Clean, no missing values; may include synthetically generated data (R¬≤ = 1 observed in some models).

## üöÄ How to Run the Application

### üì¶ Dependencies
All required packages will be automatically installed the first time you run the classification model.

### üñ•Ô∏è Running the App
To start the application, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run path_to_app.py
```
**Note**:
Ensure that path_to_app.py is located in the same directory as the required .pkl (pickled model) files. The application depends on these files being present to function correctly.

## Methodology

### Data Processing

* **Cleaning**: Removal of irrelevant and non-numeric columns.
* **Splitting**: 80/20 train-test division using `train_test_split`.
* **Scaling**: Standardization via `StandardScaler` to ensure model robustness.

### Modeling Approaches

#### Regression Models

* Linear Regression
* Polynomial Regression (built-in & manual)
* Ridge Regression (built-in & manual)
* Decision Tree Regressor
* Locally Weighted Regression

#### Classification Models

* K-Nearest Neighbors (manual)
* Logistic Regression
* Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
* XGBoost
* Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM)
